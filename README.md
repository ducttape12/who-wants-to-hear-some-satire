# Who Wants To Hear Some Satire?
A VB6 game I wrote for a high school project that a friend and I were working on.

It's VB6 and was written before I had a formal software engineering degree and years of experience as a professional software engineer... but the code isn't half bad if I do say so myself.  Just ignore that the assets were "borrowed" from the "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?" PC game :)

## Installing and Running
Clone the entire repo, run `setup.exe`, and follow the prompts.  I've confirmed it runs on Windows 11, but it can be a little slow.

## Building
You'll need a copy of Visual Basic 6.  It's been almost 20 years so I really don't remember much else.

## Cheat Code
Since we had a limited time to present this to the class, we built in a cheat that would allow us to skip to the end.  When you're answering any question, click your user name in the top left corner.  Nothing will happen, but after answering the current question your next question will be the million dollar question.

If I remember correctly, we had to use this while presenting it in class.
